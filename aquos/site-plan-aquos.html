        Your shower as you had never imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you jump out of bed and the shower is waiting for you at the perfect temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine that, with a simple gesture, you can regulate it, change the flow rate or stop it to soap up, and that after that time you can continue to enjoy the water in the same conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine having different customized profiles so that you and yours can configure the shower to your liking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine how much time and water you will have wasted every morning regulating the water temperature. Well, don't even bother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stop imagining and make room for the new Aquos smart shower.

        Advanced design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intuitive use.
        Its capacitive technology and the design of its controls make the Smart Shower very easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed for you to take control.
        Download the app and control the smart shower from your cell phone. Program your shower to your liking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secure.
        When the child mode is activated, the display is locked and does not respond to commands from the children in the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        No waiting.
        With the incredible system of automating a thermostatic valve you will be able to control its opening and regulation from a control panel or from your mobile phone. That way you can regulate the temperature of the water before it even comes out.
