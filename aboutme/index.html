    <h2>Miguel Ramirez</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Miguel Ramirez. I am from Nicaragua, but I have been living in Spain for 8 years. I am 22 years old and I am the younger of two. Something curious and unique is that my great-great-grandfather was president of Nicaragua.</p>
    <p>I was born in the church and returned from my mission about a year ago. I served in the Spain Madrid Mission.</p>
    <p>I finished BYU-Pathway last semester. Currently, I am enrolled in the online-degree Applied Technology BS course from BYU-Idaho.</p>
    <p>I love technology, music, movies and soccer.</p>
    <p>I am very excited to be in this class, get to know you and learn from all of you. Thank you for looking at my first web page.</p>
